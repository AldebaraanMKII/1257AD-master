v2.9

1). When enlisting, the lord's culture is taken when deciding which troop the player will be instead of the faction culture (e.g. If you enlist on a Hospitaller lord's army, you will be assigned the rank and equipment of a Hospitaller troop).
2). Fixed player inability of enlisting in any lord's army.
3). Fixed the correct lord's culture not being displayed in their notes.

Tier 2 troop = 50 renown

Tier 5 troop = 300 renown
Note that not all factions have mounted troops in the top tiers.

3). Player can now keep all the weapons/horses that he got from a battlefield just like the original 1257. Note: This only works for weapons IF the player doesn't have the same weapon in the same slot equipped.

1). Removed annoying notifications to player related to other factions. This includes border incidents, diplomatic announcements (war declarations, truces, etc). They will only be displayed as a message in the world map. Player will still get notification about things related to his faction however.

24). Bandits will be able to upgrade first tier troops of their associated cultures (e.g. desert bandits can upgrade to Bedouin recruits and Halqa levies)
25). New game: Fixed Templar and Hospitaller troop trees. They have the same low tier setup as the euro culture but their troop upgrade to the respective order troops. This will fix the bug in native recruitment where knights are unobtainable.

1). Changed some merc suffixes.

4). Added some native bugfixes from Floris.
5). Fixed some naming errors in bandit patrol points.
6). Buffed troops.
7). Removed some empty triggers/simple_triggers.
8). Increased some not so important triggers/simple_triggers fire time. Shall improve world map performance a bit.
9). Added some code from VC (modified by me) that made fiefs ransom their prisoners weekly. They will also earn the ransom value those prisoners have. So for example, they sold 10 prisoners that have a ransom value of 73 coins, they will have 730 coins added to their wealth, which the fief lord will earn when he collects it.
10). If chance for any of kingdom party types spawn chance is set to 0, code will no longer execute (before it did thus adding unnecessary stress to engine).
11). Player troops will position themselves more orderly at battle start (Infantry on front, archers behind. Cavalry to the left, Horse Archers to the right).
12). NPC lord parties and walled centers will update their strength checks quicker now (those checks are used to decide whether to flee or to fight).
13). Fixed Welsh not having religion set to catholic at game start.
14). Changes to kingdom reinforcement numbers.
15). Added 2 more cultures for player selection: Templar and Hospitaller.
16). Fixed some cultures in the player culture selection that were missing stuff and thus didn't get their effects applied to the player faction (Finnish, Mazovian, Anatolian and Anatolian Christian).
17). MAJOR: Plenty of changes to a few scripts and lots of simple triggers using the Viking Conquest format that shall provide pretty significant boosts to world map performance.
18). Added missing check in a simple trigger that made the game consider the player's prisoner management skill when calculating the chance of a prisoner lord escaping from the player's party. Now it's a base 30% chance every 10 hours with each point of prisoner management skill reducing the chance by 2%.
19). Reduced time that takes for released lords to respawn with a party to 3 days (it was a week).
20). Decreased diplomacy ratio (the time that takes for them to take diplomatic actions such as starting a war or making peace) of factions to 24 hours from 72.
21). MAJOR: HUGELY decreased engine load of the script that created kingdom parties (patrols, scouts, etc). Will help with world map performance.

25). Added some missing meshes from freelancer that caused errors when the freelancer menus were displayed.
26). Fixed issue where the "culture" merchant items (the ones from the culture that originally held the town at game start) were inverted with the "faction" items (the ones from the faction that currently controls the town), thus making the faction items hardly appear at all in the selection. Now faction items will be the most numerous, with culture items composing 20-40% of the selection.
27). Fixed male hair crash.
28). Added ability to chance a fief's culture to one that the player knows of. By know of i mean one of a faction that the player has joined as vassal or one that he has changed his culture to through the minister dialogue option. Cost for villages is 4000, for castles 7000 and for towns 10000. Trainer and Trade skills reduce this amount by 3% for each point in those skills for a maximum of 60% reduction.
29). Fixed enter castle scene: guards spawned were town guards instead of castle guards.
30). Reduced cost to change culture to 15k coins from 30k.
30). Some changes to faction fief guards.
31). If noble start selected, lords of the same faction as the player will recognize him without needing to speak with them first.
32). Lords will randomly build improvements on their fiefs once a week if their wealth is high enough.

33). Fixed CTT bug. Branches will work properly now but player must do follow these steps first:
     1. Start a new game
     2. Activate CTT troops through town menu or Constable
     3. Go to camp > enhanced options > fix CTT troops > select the number of branches
     4. Change the faction culture to player culture through companion minister (15k coins)
     5. Go to a fief and pay to change its culture to player culture (4-10k coins). 
     6. Done.

34). Added option to chancellor chat that allows player to pay weekly compensation to landless vassals instead of losing relations (2000 gold per vassal). Money is withdraw from treasury. Player persuasion reduces cost by 4% per level. Relation with lord reduces it by 2% every five points.
35). Fixed bug where the message displayed about increases or decreases in prosperity was reversed (e.g. "the prosperity of x has decreased from average to rich").
36). Fixed errors when building improvements.
37). Fixed message bug where if a lord was defeated in battle by a faction that was not one of the main factions (e.g. rebels) a name error would be displayed instead.
38). Decreased fief initial reinforcement rounds (the amount of troops they receive at a new game start).
39). Increased NPC lord initial reinforcement rounds.

40). Modified faction thinking process when deciding who to declare war to. Factions of the same religion are less likely to engage each other IF there's another faction in the proximity that doesn't share the same faith. 
Same religion = Neutral
Catholic and Orthodox = Aggressive
All other combinations = Very aggressive

41). Added veteran versions of Templar, Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights.
42). Added more helmets to Veteran Teutonic Turcopoles.
43). Implemented some Viking Conquest .ini settings that should improve mod loading times.
44). Added thick/reinforced shields to remaining knight tier cavalry.

Also, messages that were limited to be displayed only if the faction involved was the player faction, will now be displayed regardless of that (e.g. "X has been besieged by Y of Z").

15). Added missing exit option "Never mind" to companion's "let me ask you something".
16). Removed a duplicate option to customize CTT troops from Constable dialogue.
17). Fixed companion dialogue related to giving a fief and making him a lord. Hopefully it fixes any problems that 1257AD may have with him getting the land and functioning as a normal lord as well.
18). Added "Morale penalty based on troops quality v2.0" by kt0 and modified by lazeras (must have the "party size affects morale" option turned on in the reloaded menu)  http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,8652.msg1576674.html#msg1576674
19). Removed "previous" button from noble start faction selection presentation that was causing a bug where the player spawned right next to the kingdom's capital but without being the king and without any of the equipment or troops.
20). Updated freelancer version to the one used in the latest version of Floris (bugfixes + player will receive a quest to return to his lord in 20 days or be declared as a deserter if his lord loses a battle and he (the player) is captured, instead of having to enlist again and start from the beginning). 
21). Troops now eat once every 12 hours (it was 14) https://www.quora.com/How-many-meals-did-people-eat-in-Medieval-Europe-and-when-in-the-day-did-they-eat

30). Removed wage cap from player town controlled garrisons (it was 10.000). Now it's 30% of what the total cost of the garrison is. Should help those having issues paying for garrisons if their max cap has been set to lower numbers than default.

33). Increase world map battle speed by 3x. Also increased siege defender bonus strength to 30% from 23%, while decreasing siege attacker strength penalty to 30% from 23%. This should provide more realistic battles and sieges with the attackers losing a equal amount or 10-30% more.

35). Also gave reinforced shield to all NPC faction leaders.

8). In the previous versions, if the player selected anything other than 3 branches for their CTT troops, troops from the 3 branches still appeared as reinforcements.
